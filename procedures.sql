-- The routines you write in the database.
--
-- Write them in pgAdmin against the university database, test them there,
-- and then call them from TypeScript. Fill in the parts marked TODO.
--
-- You already have one routine in this database: danish_grade(letter), from
-- Task 5 of the database exercises. Both parts of this assignment use it, so
-- check that it is still there before you start:
--
--     SELECT danish_grade('A'), danish_grade('C-'), danish_grade(NULL);
--
-- If it is gone, the exercises folder has the file you wrote it in.

-- B2. A FUNCTION that queries and returns a result set.
--
-- student_transcript(p_id) returns one row per course the student takes,
-- with the course id, the title, and the grade **already converted** by
-- danish_grade. Order by course id.
--
-- Unlike danish_grade, this one reads tables and needs control flow, so it
-- is written in plpgsql. It must raise an exception when the student does
-- not exist:
--
--     RAISE EXCEPTION 'No student with id %', p_id;
--
-- A trap: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fails once you change which columns it
-- returns. The message tells you to drop it first:
--
--     DROP FUNCTION student_transcript(varchar);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION student_transcript(p_id varchar)
RETURNS TABLE (course_id varchar, title varchar, grade varchar)

 /* an unknown student is an error, not an empty transcript */

  /* table aliases and the p_ prefix avoid clashes with the output column
     names; the casts make the types match RETURNS TABLE exactly */

--     SELECT * FROM student_transcript('99999');   -- an error

-- B3. A PROCEDURE that changes several things.
--
-- enrol_student must:
--   look up the credits of the course, and raise an exception when the
--     course does not exist
--   insert a row into takes, with a null grade
--   add the course credits to the student's tot_cred
--   report the student's new total through the INOUT parameter
--
-- A procedure, not a function, because it exists to change things rather
-- than to answer a question.
